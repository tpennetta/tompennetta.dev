I tried to think of my earliest memories of computing and technology that created this passion for coding and software. My father has run his own HVAC company for longer than I have been on this Earth. He would work on large commercial project planning and manage HR from our home PC. If memory serves, the machine was a 286 processor and 512k of RAM, which was a big deal. At the time, I only saw my father making a ton of noise banging on a keyboard staring into a weird black screen.

If my career was a RPG, my class would be the *Overly Ambitious Tactician*. I wasn't able to see this until well further into my career than I would like to admit.

**Overly Amitious Tactitian**

A typical conversation:

> **Person X:** "Can we make the application do `<insert objective here>`?"
>> **Me:** "Absolutely, in fact we should allow for `<unnecessary bloat>` in case `<imaginary situation>` or spike in `<never gonna happen>` and build it out with `<over-complexity>`. We can finish by `<ha-ha-ha>`!"
